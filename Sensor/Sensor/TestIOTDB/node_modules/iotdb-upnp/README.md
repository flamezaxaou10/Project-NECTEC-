# iotdb-upnp
Universal Plug &amp; Play Library - for IOTDB and Stand Alone

# Credits
This is based on https://github.com/stormboy/node-upnp-controlpoint
but the code has been massively rewritten. Still, all
kudos to stormboy.

# Installation

This is designed for use within IOTDB / HomeStar, so ideally

    homestar install iotdb-upnp

It will work outside of that environment to, in which case
you can do the normal but not recommended

    npm install iotdb-upnp
